# Driver Sleep Detection & Alarming System
Driver Sleep Detection and Alarming System feeling sleepy while driving could cause hazardous traffic accident. However, when driving alone on highway or driving over a long period of time, drivers are inclined to bored and feel sleepy, or even fall asleep.  Therefore, we came up with an idea to develop a driver anti-sleep alarm system, which could effectively meet this demand.

Tech/ Supplies Used : Arduino IDE, Arduino Nano, Obstacle Avoidance IR sensor, Buzzer alarm, Battery, Switches and Jumper Cables.
